# Introduction to Jupyter Notebook

This tutorial is designed to get you started using Jupyter Notebook, a powerful open-source web application that allows you to create and share complex documents that can include text and images, but also live code and visualizations. "Jupyter" comes from the three core languages that the notebook supports: Julia, Python, and R. 

We'll be following along with this [introduction to Jupyter Notebook](https://realpython.com/jupyter-notebook-introduction/) to get started.

# Styling Text in Your Notebook

As noted in the previous section, there are several different cell types available in Juptyer Notebook, including Code (in our case, Python) and Markdown. Markdown is an easy means of creating richly styled text using minimal text-based formatting commands. (In fact, this page is written in Markdown.) There are two other cell types listed in that little dropdown menu: Heading, which Jupyter will warn you not to use, and Raw NBConvert, which we won't be using.

For the moment, click on your first cell again to highlight it, and then use the Insert menu to insert a cell above it.

Using that dropdown menu, change this cell type to Markdown. Note that the "In [ ]" notation disappears from the left margin, indicating that this cell is not runnable.

Now, use this cell to create some introductory text for your notebook using Markdown formatting. There's a great tutorial on using Markdown in Jupyter Notebook at [DataCamp](https://www.datacamp.com/community/tutorials/markdown-in-jupyter-notebook), but for the moment here are a few key tips:

1. The pound sign creates headings; one pound sign creates a level 1 heading, two creates a level 2 heading, and so on.
2. You can create italicized text by placing one asterisk before and after the text, and bold text by using two asterisks.
3. You can create unordered lists by starting each of a series of new lines with a hyphen, and ordered lists by starting each of a series of new lines with a number.
